braid my hair
can be creative
can be messy
carry chapstick
dance in my room
don't brush my teeth
don't make my bed
don't shower in the morning
drink milk
like eating out
like reality TV shows
like sleepovers
like to doodle
like to wear hats 
like wearing makeup
listen to music
read magazines
sing in the shower
stay up late
take bubble baths 
try new foods
wear leggings
wear sunglasses
burn my toast
forget people's names
forget to turn off lights
go barefoot
like burning candles
like cold pizza
like leftovers
like watching sports  
like wearing costumes
paint my nails
play board games
sleep in late
try to recycle
wear bright colors 
wear flip flops
wear PJs all day
help around the house
have too many chores
forget to wear sunscreen
