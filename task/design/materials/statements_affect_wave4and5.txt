act without thinking
am good at getting my way
can be mean
can get moody
can't count on my family
can't ignore gossip
can't keep secrets
can't stop worrying
count calories
dislike my body
don't like my life
dream about my wedding
feel lonely
feel pressured to drink
feel shy in groups
fight with my family
get irritated easily
get mad at my friends
get self-conscious
hate school 
hide my feelings
pretend I'm fine
pretend to like people
want to be alone
want to be popular
wish I was in love 
worry about college
worry about grades
worry about kissing
copy homework
judge people
like breaking rules
tell little lies
think I'm weird
like flirting
make friends easily
can be awkward
get picked on
think I'm smart
think I look cute
regret what I post online
get embarrassed
